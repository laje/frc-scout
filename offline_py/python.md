##Using the Offline Python GameScout

This offline version of the game scouter was something that I wanted to make just in case. If people actually want to do this, It's unlikely they'll want to do it on phones or tablets. Since Wi-Fi at the matches is sort of a no-no, people using laptops without usb or bluetooth tethering wouldn't be able to get online. This is my solution. 

It's a straightforward python program, simple to use. Using python 2.7, run `$ python game_tk.py`.

Offline files are stored with a unique name, so if you need to make multiple files for a single team, that's okay.
